# Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy-Using-Linear_Regression
# 🚖 Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Cab Fare

This project explores a **dynamic pricing strategy for cab fares** using various regression techniques.  
The goal is to implement and evaluate **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression** models to optimize fare pricing based on demand and supply factors.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project involves:
- 🔹 **Exploring Linear Regression** → Building and validating a basic regression model  
- 🔹 **Assumption Testing** → Verifying assumptions like multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity  
- 🔹 **Applying Ridge Regression** → Implementing Ridge regression to improve model performance  
- 🔹 **Applying Lasso Regression** → Implementing Lasso regression for model selection and regularization
